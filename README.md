1. Project Overview

The HR Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard is a data-driven project developed to analyze and understand the patterns of employee turnover within an organization. Employee attrition, or the rate at which employees leave the company, is a critical metric for HR departments as it impacts recruitment costs, employee morale, and organizational productivity.

This dashboard provides insights into demographics, job roles, departments, and compensation trends, helping HR managers identify key drivers of attrition and take proactive measures to retain talent.

2. Objectives

To analyze the attrition rate across gender, age groups, and marital status.

To study department-wise and job role-wise attrition trends.

To correlate attrition with salary levels and identify high-risk employee groups.

To provide an interactive dashboard in Power BI that HR teams can use for continuous monitoring.

To generate data-driven recommendations for improving employee retention.

3. Dataset Description

The dataset used includes anonymized employee details such as:

Personal Attributes: Age, Gender, Marital Status.

Employment Details: Department, Job Role, Years at Company.

Compensation: Monthly/Annual Salary.
